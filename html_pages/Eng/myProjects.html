                        <br>This is one of my first projects that I created!
                        <br>
                        <br>This project allows you to play the famous Tic Tac Toe game with a friend on the same screen,
                        <br>or with a bot that I developed myself.
                        <br>The goal is to offer a simple and intuitive gaming session for a smooth and enjoyable experience.

                        <br>The goal of the game is to place 3 shapes in a row.
                        <br>For example:
                        <br>
                        <br> X | O | O
                        <br> X | X | X
                        <br> O | O | 
                        <br>
                        <br>In this example, player X wins because they placed 3 Xs in a row!

                            The game was created in Python using Tkinter, a standard module for building graphical user interfaces (GUI).
                        <br>Tkinter is a built-in Python library that makes it easy to create windows, buttons, labels (titles), and many other interactive elements.
                        <br>It is an ideal tool for designing simple and fast applications with a user-friendly interface.
                        <br>
                        <br>Tkinter and many other libraries are created by the community, meaning other contributors make it possible for people like me to develop such projects.
